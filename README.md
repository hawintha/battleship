# Battleship
> This project was developed as my solution to The Odin Project's [Battleship Assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-battleship)

This is an interactive browser-based game built with JavaScript and is based on the classic [Battleship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)) board game.

## Features
- **Drag-Drop Ship Positioning:** Players can place their ships on any valid area of the board during the initial setup.
- **Smart AI:** Players will play against the computer that is capable of making smart shots. First, the AI will randomly shoot all over the board until a hit successfully lands on one of the player's ships. Without cheating, the AI will aim around the hit or aim in the same orientation of adjacent hits until all the hits have sunk the ship.
- **Character Reactions:** Characters will react to the ongoing battle by displaying messages and changing their facial expressions.
